## The backstory

I cut my teeth in multimedia, primarily working on e-learning, training, and press pack applications for prominent publishers such as **BBC Worldwide**, **BBC Active**, **University of Cambridge**, **Oxford University Press**, **UKTV**, and **Kellogg's** with the award winning agency - Fifth Dimension Productions.

As distribution shifted from physical (PC/Mac CD-ROMs) to online, I transferred my skills to Front-End development, initially creating support sites for physical products like [BBC Active's Get Into French - IVCA Gold award winner](https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/get-into-french-wins-gold-award) and then progressing to full online-only solutions.

In 2009, the agency refocused its efforts and established itself as **the** marketing agency for Europe's emerging payments sector. Since then, I've concentrated solely on Front-End development, mostly within the fintech landscape.

## Workflow

All of my prototypes are built with static site generators, previously [Panini](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/panini.html) within the Foundation framework, and more recently [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) within [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). This component-based approach ensures that the presentation is consistent and that each template is up to date with the most recent changes. Headers and footers, for example, can be changed and instantly applied across all templates.

Using a <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr> to prototype allows me to respond to clients quickly while also reassuring the development team about any potentially breaking changes.

A set of static templates that is well-maintained will bridge the client-development gap, keeping both parties informed. This reduces the likelihood of project creep due to assumptions or misunderstandings.

Context is essential for a concise translation on multilingual websites. Third-party translators can use a static template listing to follow the user path or view the entire page context without the need for test accounts or sandbox transactions.

## What comes next? 
This static site was built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and integrates [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/). It replaces the previous version that was authored using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). I've enjoyed learning Astro and will look for opportunities to apply it into other personal projects.

## Balance and wellbeing
I love spending time exploring the great outdoors with my family; we have two adventurous young boys, and it gives me great joy to see them thrive in nature. I find that getting away from the interruptions and rhythms of daily life helps me regain a sense of balance and wellbeing.

The boys are at a naturally inquisitive age and whilst I do my best to tackle their questions... we often have to resort to [Google Lens](https://lens.google/intl/en-GB/#cta-section) for the answers!
