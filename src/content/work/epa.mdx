## Overview

The Emerging Payments Association was founded with the goal of making the United Kingdom a global leader in payments innovation. Membership in the EPA provided access to resources to promote innovation, growth, and advocacy.

The client required a public resource for industry news and events, as well as secure members-only access to projects, whitepapers, resources, and an EPA network of over 3,700 companies. The high quality of the public content would funnel prospects to sign up for memberships.

## My responsibilities

-   The designs and static templates were hosted in a secure listing to keep stakeholders informed throughout the development process. <span class="label label--info !m-0">Project management</span>
-   Working from a brief wireframe document, I used Photoshop to design six core layouts. Paying close attention to the client's feedback, I was able to keep revisions to a minimum.
-   I created all of the Front-End HTML templates – working to a mobile-first mindset. These were then handed over to a team of back-end developers, complete with detailed annotations, listing indexes, and support documentation.
-   I collaborated closely with the developers to ensure that the site stayed true to the visuals approved by the client.
-   I assisted in configuring the content management system (Umbraco) and took responsibility for the initial population of all launch content. <span class="label label--info !m-0">collaboration</span>


As new sections became available for review, the index listings were updated to keep the client informed. This reactive approach allowed me to hand over the initial templates to developers without having to wait for the entire set. It also prevented any client surprises because they were viewing a realistic 'working' version of the site.

I collaborated closely with the developers to ensure that the site stayed true to the visuals approved by the client.
Umbraco was used to create the development website. I was able to populate the site with real content from the first instance and continued to do so until the live site was launched.

## Final comments

These images have been captured from static templates, but they accurately represent the site that was launched. Fifth dimension (the agency) reformed as K Wearables, a start-up focused on launching the world’s first contactless payment ring, [K Ring](/work/mykring), and the live site has since been redesigned.
